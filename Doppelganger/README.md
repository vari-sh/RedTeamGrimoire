# üé≠ Doppelganger ‚Äì Advanced LSASS Dumper with PPL Bypass and Process Cloning

**Doppelganger** is a powerful LSASS dumping tool for red team operations. It bypasses Protected Process Light (PPL), clones `lsass.exe`, and performs a stealthy memory dump ‚Äì encrypted and ready for offline extraction.

Unlike traditional tools, Doppelganger works on modern Windows with PPL enabled by:
- Using a BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) to disable PPL
- Cloning `lsass.exe` to evade direct memory access detection
- Dumping and XOR-obfuscating the clone to disk

üõ†Ô∏è Built in C, designed for stealth, and compatible with process hollowing frameworks like HollowReaper.

> üß† Ideal for red teamers, malware developers, or researchers needing full LSASS dumps on hardened targets.

## üìú The Ritual
### üé≠ Doppelganger

üõ°Ô∏è Disables PPL using the cursed RTCore64.sys driver (BYOVD)

üß¨ Clones LSASS into a benign replica

üíæ Creates a Minidump from the clone

üóùÔ∏è XOR-encrypts the dump and writes it to disk, leaving behind only a shadow

üìú Writes logs in C:\Users\Public\log.txt

### üßø Utilities
#### üíÄ HollowReaper.c
The vessel for your payload. This performs process hollowing, carving out a legitimate process and injecting your shellcode into its husk.
üîß Instructions for generating the shellcode to embed are provided in the HollowReaper project.

#### üîê decrypt_xor_dump.py
A local decryption utility. Use this to restore the original dump from its XOR-obfuscated form.

#### üé´ raw_TGT_extractor_win11.py
Extracts raw Kerberos tickets from the minidump.

## ‚öóÔ∏è The Components
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Doppelganger | The shellcode: disable PPL, clone LSASS, dump and XOR |
| HollowReaper.c |	Hollow a process and inject shellcode |
| decrypt_xor_dump.py | Python tool to decrypt XOR dump |
| RTCore64.sys | Vulnerable driver used for PPL bypass (BYOVD) |

## üïØÔ∏è Usage Flow
### Standalone
In order to use Doppelganger you must place RTCore64.sys in C:\Users\Public. Doppleganger can be used standalone or hollowed through HollowReaper.
```
.\Doppelganger.exe
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Process Hollowed

1Ô∏è‚É£ Compile Doppelganger

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Donut to convert it into shellcode
```
.\donut.exe -a 2 -f 7 -i Doppelganger.exe
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ XOR the shellcode and embed it into HollowReaper.c (look for util files in [HollowReaper](https://github.com/vari-sh/RedTeamGrimoire/tree/main/HollowReaper))

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run HollowReaper to hollow a process and trigger Doppelganger (all files saved to C:\Users\Public)
```
.\HollowReaper.exe "C:\windows\explorer.exe"
```
5Ô∏è‚É£ Use decrypt_xor_dump.py to decrypt the dumped file offline
```
python .\decrypt_xor_dump.py .\doppelganger.dmp
```

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Counterspell - YARA Rules

The following YARA rules can be used to detect Doppelganger binary, artifacts, and opcode stubs in memory or on disk.

These rules were generated using [`yarGen`](https://github.com/Neo23x0/yarGen) to match unique patterns such as string constants related to the Doppelganger LSASS dumper.
